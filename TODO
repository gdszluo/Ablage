Tenant beim erstlogin setzen

= Search

Provide a search page which uses the http://d-ablage.appspot.com/uid/search API and displayes the results in
an ExtJS grid.


= Upload

Provie the user with an Interface to upload a Dokument file and associated Meta-Data using the
http://d-ablage.appspot.com/CYLGI/docs interface.


= Files > 1 MB

Currently files are stored in the Datastore. Provide an alternative REST upload mechanism using the Blobstore
API which alows files to be uploaded to the AppEngine blobstore. Use `Dokument.storage_location` to
destinguish the two and ensure the HTTP API for reading Documents/PDFs also works regardless if PDFs are
stored in the blobstore or in the datastore.


= S3 Export

a) provide a GUI per Tenant where s3 credentials and a destination bucket can be set.
b) on each Document file save export two files to S3: the PDF file and a JSON file containing the metadata.


= Auditing

All changes to models should be logged. Meaning there should be a `AuditLog` Model which containse entries
like "User mdornseif changed field `seit` on Akte (<designator>) from '2010-10-01' to '2010-11-01'". Best
implementation strategy is probably to warp all the properties of an model and overwrite tue __set__ method
of the properties.
